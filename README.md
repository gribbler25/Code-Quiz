##Bugs still to be worked out

* I have yet to figure out how to successfully git the user initials and score to store to the User object that I have in local storage.
* I have yet to figure out why my "Correct!" and "Wrong!" text is persisting through the next question and also not positioned in footer area as I understand it.
* I have yet to pay close attention to style, having used most of my time on function.
